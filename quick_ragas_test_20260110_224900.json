The AFT determined that his case for promotion to the rank of Captain from Commander had been duly considered, and he was found unfit for empanelment. This conclusion was based on the merit list, where the last officer empaneled was ranked 26, while Maj. Gen. Ganguly stood at rank 52, indicating a significant gap. Consequently, the AFT rejected his contentions for promotion, compensation, and other inquiries, finding the application to be without merit and dismissing it in limine.",

    "generated_answer": "The appellants did not explicitly disclose the reasons for not promoting Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly to the position of Director General of Medical Services (Army) in the provided context. However, it is highlighted that the merit lists, which are used in promotion decisions, are not divulged after Selection Boards or Promotion Boards. This policy is intended to prevent demotivation among officers who may feel discouraged if they know their ranking or likelihood of promotion. The emphasis is placed on maintaining the morale of the officers and encouraging them to continue performing to the best of their abilities.\n\nAdditionally, the context suggests that the information sought by the officer regarding the merit list and related details was not disclosed by the legal forums, which upheld that such information could not be shared in the interest of the Armed Forces. Therefore, while the specific reasons for denying the promotion to Maj. Gen. Ganguly are not stated, they are likely tied to the general practice of confidentiality regarding merit assessments and promotions within the military.",
