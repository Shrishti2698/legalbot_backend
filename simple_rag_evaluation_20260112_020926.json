      "question": "What decision did the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) make regarding Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly's promotion?",
      "ground_truth": "The AFT directed the appellants to post Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly as DGMS (Army) as expeditiously as possible and within one month from the date of the judgement.",
      "generated_answer": "The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) dismissed the application of Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly regarding his promotion. The AFT found that his case for promotion to the rank of Captain from the rank of Commander had been duly considered and that he was not found fit for empanelment. The AFT noted that the merit of the last officer who had been empaneled was significantly higher than that of Ganguly, who stood at a much lower position on the merit list. Consequently, all of his prayers, including requests for compensation and further inquiries, were rejected, and the Tribunal deemed his application to be without merit.",

Gen. Manomoy Ganguly's promotion. Instead, it discusses a dismissal of an application related to a different rank and context. The accuracy is low because it contradicts the ground truth, which states that the AFT directed his posting as DGMS (Army), rather than dismissing his application. The completeness is slightly better, as it provides some context about the AFT's considerations, but it ultimately fails to address the core of the question, leading to a low score overall."

      "question": "What was the reason given by the appellants for not promoting Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly to DGMS (Army)?",
      "ground_truth": "The appellants argued that Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly was not found suitable for the position based on an inter se assessment of suitability among eligible officers.",
      "generated_answer": "The reason given by the appellants for not promoting Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly to the position of DGMS (Army) was related to the non-communication of the 'good' entry for the year 1993-94 to the appellant. They argued that the lack of this information led to the exclusion of his merits from consideration for promotion. Furthermore, it was emphasized that the elimination process followed in selection for promotion could cause significant career damage to an officer who otherwise had an outstanding track record, leading to potential injustice and demoralization among officers who are superseded despite being meritorious. \n\nThis reasoning reflects concerns about the transparency and fairness of the promotion process within the Armed Forces, specifically regarding how merit lists and entries are communicated to officers.",

Manomoy Ganguly, but it diverges from the specific ground truth by focusing on the non-communication of a 'good' entry rather than the inter se assessment of suitability among eligible officers. The accuracy is lower because it does not accurately reflect the reason given by the appellants as stated in the ground truth. The completeness is moderate; while it provides additional context about the promotion process and its implications, it does not fully address the core reason for the decision as outlined in the ground truth."

      "question": "How did the Supreme Court of India rule on the appeal against the AFT's decision?",
      "ground_truth": "The Supreme Court of India upheld the AFT's decision and dismissed the appeal, affirming that Maj. Gen. Manomoy Ganguly was entitled to the promotion as DGMS (Army).",
      "generated_answer": "I can only provide information related to Indian legal matters.

Instead, it diverts to a different legal context related to the Right to Information Act, which is not pertinent to the question asked. The accuracy is low because it fails to reflect the actual ruling of the Supreme Court, which upheld the AFT's decision. Completeness is also low, as the answer does not provide any information about the case or the ruling itself, leaving the question unanswered."
